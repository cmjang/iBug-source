Last year (maybe September? I don't remember now) I switched my primary browser from Google Chrome to the new Microsoft Edge. It turned out to be a wise move and I've been with Edge for more than half a year now. I'll share my ideas with this move.

## What I thought before I switched {#thoughts-before}

The moment Microsoft Edge went attractive was when I learned that **it started to be Chromium-based**, so that web pages will behave identially as if they were on Google Chrome or the Chromium browser.
