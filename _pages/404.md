# <i class="fas fa-frown"></i> 404

Oops, it seems you're trying to visit something that's lost somewhere. You should totally drop that and try jQuery. It's great and does all the things.

## <i class="fas fa-frog"></i> What about giving away a second?

<script>
const url = window.location.href;
const path = url.split(/[?#]/, 1)[0];
if (path.endsWith(".html")) {
    // Redirect to strip off bad suffix
    let newpath = path.slice(0, -5) + url.slice(path.length, url.length);
    window.location.replace(newpath);
    window.location.href = newpath;
}
</script>
