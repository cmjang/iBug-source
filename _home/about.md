---

Undergraduate CS student at [USTC][USTC], hobbiest programmer and passionate geek. Primarily a developer, often a DevOps engineer and Linux SysAdmin.

Python, C and C++ are my primary options for course labs and new projects, though I always like trying something new (and that's why I have a little taste of everything).

Also loves casual and puzzle gaming.

## In action

I'm an active contributor on GitHub across various repositories. You can see a list of all my pull requests [using GitHub search][all-prs].

I'm also an avid user on Stack Overflow:

MSI produces high-performance gaming laptops with *very* comfortable and beautiful keyboards. Must buy!

## Personally

- **Primary languages**:
  - Chinese
    - Native to Simplified (written) and Mandarin (oral)
    - Reads Traditional without problem but limited in writing
  - English (Proficient as a foreign language, prefer American flavor)
- **Secondary languages**: French (advancing), Spanish (limited vocabulary)
- **Minor language(s)**: Italian (can read with a dictionary)
  - Also can identify a wide range of Latin-script languages, though without understanding a single word.
{% comment %}
  - Note on contacting: Using Chinese usually infers a casual talk, so unless you write very formal Chinese documents (e-mails, GitHub issues, etc.) to me, you will likely get a casually-written response, in IM chat-flavor language, and sometimes incoherent. Meanwhile, I'm careful when writing English and often try to be serious. Prefer English if you expect professional talks.
