## [OJSandbox](https://github.com/taoky/OJSandbox) {#OJSandbox}
An experimental sandbox for online judgers (OJ) utilizing multiple Linux features, including rlimit, cgroup and chroot. I am a co-author.

## [(Charcoal) Smoke Detector](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector) ([<i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> Website](https://charcoal-se.org/)) {#SmokeDetector}
A community-driven chatbot that detects spam across the Stack Exchange Network and reports them, so they can be quickly removed.

I joined the team in December 2017, and [was recognized as a developer](/p/3) in March 2018.

This is the largest project in this page and also the first existing project that I've joined (all other projects are started from scratch).

## USTC Virtualization Laboratory {#vlab}
A unified course experiment platform involving code storage (GitLab CE) and experiment environment (virtual machines).
Students log in to their accounts and manage or connect to their virtual machines,
and can do course experiments anywhere without having to spin up messy environments on their own.

The VM manager itself is a Django app, and the front end utilizes Twitter Bootstrap.
The VM backend currently consists of LXD and QEMU / libvirt / KVM, with storage part involving LVM and ZFS.

## [Chisel RISC-V](https://github.com/iBug/USTC-RV-Chisel) {#RISC-V}
A Chisel implementation of the RISC-V CPU aiming to pave the way for its application in school teaching,
across several courses, including *Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)*, *Computer Organization and Design (COD)* and more.
It consists of a RISC-V-based SoC design (hardware) and a full set of toolchain to compile C programs for the SoC.

It is currently under development.

## [Jekyll Environment Variables](https://github.com/iBug/jekyll-environment-variables) {#jekyll-environment-variables}
A Jekyll plugin that enables the use of environment variables in Liquid templates.
I have published it [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-environment-variables) and it has accumulated a total download of 25k,
which IMO indicates its non-trivial impact to the Jekyll community.
It also gathered some discussion on its [issue board](https://github.com/iBug/jekyll-environment-variables/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

## [Tetris with AI](/project/TetrisAI) {#TetrisAI}
A good game automation that you *must* try and watch!

## [SpaceRider](https://github.com/iBug/SpaceRider) {#SpaceRider}
An old Flash plane-shooting game that I made when I was 13. ActionScript 2.0 (so expect that it won't run very fluently on a low-end computer)

## [Python Reversi](https://github.com/iBug/PyReversi) {#PyReversi}
An implementation of the classic Reversi / Othello game using Python and PyQt5. It has an intensive AI that's hard to beat.

## [Aurora Theme](https://ibugone.com/aurora-theme) {#Aurora}
Aurora is a clean, responsive Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

It was the theme for my Project Pages before I moved completely to Minimal Mistakes. I have published this theme [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/aurora-theme).

I have another set of [smaller projects](/small-projects) that I don't think is worth showing here, but you're free to explore them if you're interested.
