## Games

- [Grand Theft Auto V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/) - My first legal copy of game bought from Steam
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) - Needs no explanation! (User ID: `iBugOne`)

### Microsoft Solitaire Collection

I play MSC a lot so it is worth a dedicated section for description. (Xbox User ID: `iBugOne`)

Here are my stats:

I particularly like FreeCell and I've finished all FC challanges in Star Club. The Expert level FC games are very enjoyable! I'm currently working on getting 100% on Pyramids challenges because it's almost as fun.

### Minesweeper

I started practicing Minesweeper when I was 15, and I can now complete a Hard board (30x16, 99 mines) within 3 minutes (personal best 162 sec). I also have the record of completing a Hard board **without using flags** on a touchscreen in less than 6 minutes.

To sum up, logical deduction is fun for me.

## Music

- Mixtape - *Barcella* ([<i class="fab fa-fw fa-youtube"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lavSP2spE14))

## Movies & TV

- *Mr. Bean* series from the 1990s
  - I particularly like the scene where Mr. Bean drives off sitting on the roof of his Mini. ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6VaYr7xOsw&t=12m11s))
- *Johnny English*, also by Rowan Atkinson
- *The Lion King* (1994), **not** the 2019-refurbished version
- *The Big Bang Theory*
